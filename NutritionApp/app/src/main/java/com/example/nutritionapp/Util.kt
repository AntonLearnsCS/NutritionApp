/**
 * A sealed class that encapsulates successful outcome with a value of type [T]
 * or a failure with message and statusCode
 */
//TODO: Where can I go to get more information on the use of this sealed class?
//So you have the option to use one of each data class when a data type is wrapped in Result<>
//"data" in: data class Success<out T : Any>(val data: T) : Result<T>() refers to any data type wrapped by Result. In the case of
//"Result<List<ReminderDTO>>", data refers to <List<ReminderDTO>>

//We are able to wrap Result around any data type b/c we specify the generic T as being of type "Any". So the "T" in "(val data: T)"
//can allows "data" to be any data type that extends (via keyword out) "Any". If we only wanted Result to encapsulate data types that
//extend "Number" then we could write: data class Success<out T : Number>(val data: T) : Result<T>() . Alternatively, if we want the
//opposite, meaning data types that are super to Integer i.e Number,
// we could do: data class Success<in T : Number>(val data: T) : Result<T>()

// "<out T : Any>" is the signature, so that when we use Result, we can create only objects that extend the
// "Any" i.e val mResult : Result<Any> = Result<listOf(1,2,3)>
